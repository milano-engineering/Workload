# Jakarta EE8

Optimizing Enterprise Java for a Microservices Architecture

## Microprofile

  * ***Configuration*** - Externalize and manage your configuration parameters outside your micro-services.
  * ***Fault Tolerance*** - All about bulkheads, timeouts, circuit breakers, retries, etc.
  * ***JWT Propagation*** - Propagate security across your micro-services.
  * ***Metrics*** - Gather and create operational and business measurements.
  * ***Health Checks*** - Verify the health of your micro-services.
  * ***Open API*** - Generate OpenAPI-compliant API documentation.
  * ***Open Tracing*** - Trace the flow of requests as they traverse your micro-services.
  * ***Rest Client*** - Invoke RESTful services in a type-safe manner.
  
## The Twelve Factors
 I. Codebase
  One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
 II. Dependencies
  Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
 III. Config
  Store config in the environment
 IV. Backing services
  Treat backing services as attached resources
 V. Build, release, run
  Strictly separate build and run stages
 VI. Processes
  Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
 VII. Port binding
  Export services via port binding
 VIII. Concurrency
  Scale out via the process model
 IX. Disposability
  Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
 X. Dev/prod parity
  Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
 XI. Logs
  Treat logs as event streams
 XII. Admin processes
  Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
